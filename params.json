{"body":"# Trooper\r\n\r\nTrooper is designed to give you the flexibility to deploy your code to any server in any way you like.\r\nYou design your deployment strategy to best fit your application and its needs. \r\nTrooper comes with some built in actions that you can use in your own strategies or come up with entirely new ones.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Super easy! `gem install trooper` or add it to your Gemfile `gem \"trooper\", \"~> 0.6.1\"`\r\n2. Pop into your terminal and run `=> trooper init`\r\n3. Start building you deployment strategy :)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n`=> trooper deploy -e stage` or `=> trooper update`\r\n\r\n#### Action\r\n\r\nAn Action is a set of commands to be run in sequence, they should be small units of work. Trooper \r\ncomes with some build in actions but you can of course overwrite them or ignore all together. \r\nActions can also be run locally by adding the local: true option\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\naction :migrate_database, 'Migrating database' do\r\n  cd application_path\r\n  rake \"db:migrate RAILS_ENV=#{environment}\"\r\nend\r\n\r\naction :precompile_assets, 'Precompile assets', local: true do\r\n  run 'do_stuff'\r\n  rake \"assets:precompile\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Strategy\r\n\r\nA Strategy is collection of actions to be executed in sequence, A Strategy can call other\r\nstrategies and have prerequisites.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nstrategy :my_strategy_name, \"A Description of what the strategy does\" do\r\n  actions :clone_repository, :install_gems, :migrate_database\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you've defined the your strategy you can call it e.g. `=> trooper my_strategy_name`\r\n\r\n#### Prerequisite\r\n\r\nA Prerequisite is a Strategy that can only run once per host\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Example Troopfile\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nuser 'my_user'\r\nhosts 'production1.example.com', 'production2.example.com'\r\nrepository 'git@git.foo.co.uk:bar.git'\r\npath \"/fullpath/to/data/folder\"\r\n\r\nset :my_value => 'something'\r\n\r\nenv :stage do\r\n  hosts 'stage.example.com',\r\n  set :my_value => 'something_else'\r\n\r\n  action :restart do\r\n    run 'touch tmp/restert.txt'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\naction :restart, 'Restarting the server' do\r\n  run 'touch tmp/restert.txt'\r\n  run \"echo 'Restarted'\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nstrategy :bootstrap, \"Bootstrap application\" do\r\n  actions :setup_trooper, :clone_repository\r\nend\r\n\r\nstrategy :update, 'Update the code base on the server' do\r\n  prerequisites :bootstrap\r\n  actions :update_repository, :install_gems\r\n  call :restart\r\nend\r\n\r\nstrategy :deploy, 'Full deployment to the server' do\r\n  prerequisites :bootstrap\r\n  call :update\r\n  actions :migrate_database\r\n  call :restart\r\nend\r\n\r\nstrategy :restart, 'Restart application' do\r\n  actions :restart\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 Richard Adams\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
